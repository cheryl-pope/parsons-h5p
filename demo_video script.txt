We first create a fill in the blank type of parsons puzzle which also uses drag and drop function.

This code block creates drag and drop panel of the problem.

The toggle syntax is used to create a blank with options of values for the fill in the blank

The python test script is for testing students' solution. These test cases need to be added for just fill in the blank type.
so we chose to create a fill in the blank, then add 2 test cases.



First, we initiate the input variable of the test.
and we display the test information to the students.
Then we add the correct results to compare with students outputs.


We copy the codes lines. These code lines will be recognised as draggable objects

This is the problem panel from where students drag the objects to the solution panel.
The students can click the blank to switch values

For the second drag and drop question, the students can drag and drop, and indent the line

After the student finish the question, they can get the feedback. The 2 test cases we added are used to show the student the error they have created. If they solved it successfully, it shows a message of success

The student can submit the quiz and get the result. They can also check the results of all quizzes

Then another student can log and attempt. This time we'll do it correctly

Then we log in as instructor again to check all students attempt






we haven't added the limit of number of temps at this time. it can be used to improve what we have implemented
